### 23andMe Sales Data Analysis
Stratascratch data project which asks the following questions: 

1. Plot daily sales for all 50 weeks.
2. It looks like there has been a sudden change in daily sales. What date did it occur?
3. Is the change in daily sales at the date you selected statistically significant? If so, what is the p-value?
4. Does the data suggest that the change in daily sales is due to a shift in the proportion of male-vs-female customers? Please use plots to support your answer (a rigorous statistical analysis is not necessary).
5. Assume a given day is divided into four dayparts:
   * night (12:00AM - 6:00AM),
   * morning (6:00AM - 12:00PM),
   * afternoon (12:00PM - 6:00PM),
   * evening (6:00PM - 12:00AM). 

What is the percentage of sales in each daypart over all 50 weeks?
